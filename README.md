This Sublime Text plugin adds a handful of context menu commands that are useful when working on Standard Ebooks ebook sources.

# Installation

This plugin isn’t available on Package Control. Refer to the official Sublime Text documentation on [how to manually install plugins](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/packages.html).

To install it, clone this repo into Sublime Text's packages folder, usually `<data_path>/Packages/`.

`<data_path>` depends on your computer’s operating system. On Linux, it might be `~/.config/sublime-text/`. On Windows, it might be `\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text\`. Refer to the [official documentation](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/revert.html) for details.

For example:

```bash
cd ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/
git clone https://github.com/standardebooks/sublime-text-se-plugin
```

Restart Sublime Text to complete the installation.

If you have Package Control installed, you can check if installation was successful by using the command palette command: `Package Control: List Unmanaged Packages`.
