This Sublime Text plugin is not currently available on Package Control. You may refer to official documentations from Sublime Text on how to manually install it [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/packages.html). Below is a short step-by-step installation guide:

1. Download the source code via the **Download ZIP** link under the `code` button drop-down

2. Rename the zip archive to `sublime-text-se-plugin.sublime-package` (note the file extension change).
3. Copy the renamed archive to `<data_path>/Installed Packages/` on your local machine. `<data_path>` would depends on your computer's operating system. For example, for Windows machine this would be `\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text\`.
4. Restart Sublime Text if already running.
5. Check if the plug-in was installed via the command palette command: `Package Control: List Unmanaged Packages`. (Note: This check is only available if you have Package Control installed.)
